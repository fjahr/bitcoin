/** A class representing MuHash sets
 *
 * MuHash is a hashing algorithm that supports adding set elements in any
 * order but also deleting in any order. As a result, it can maintain a
 * running sum for a set of data as a whole, and add/subtract when data
 * is added to or removed from it. A downside of MuHash is that computing
 * an inverse is relatively expensive. This can be solved by representing
 * the running value as a fraction, and multiplying added elements into
 * the numerator and removed elements into the denominator. Only when the
 * final hash is desired, a single modular inverse and multiplication is
 * needed to combine the two.
 *
 * As the update operations are also associative, H(a)+H(b)+H(c)+H(d) can
 * in fact be computed as (H(a)+H(b)) + (H(c)+H(d)). This implies that
 * all of this is perfectly parallellizable: each thread can process an
 * arbitrary subset of the update operations, allowing them to be
 * efficiently combined later.
